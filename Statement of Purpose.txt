""" 
I want to make a program for the game Diablo 3 that will take player 
input about their weapons, armor, etc. and turn that information into 
useful statistics about their damage, DPS, crits, multipliers, maybe even
toughness eventually to improve on the way the in game sheet dps works
but even go a step further than existing excel sheets by having a side-by-
side comparison table where you can change one or more pieces of equipment
or skills for a macro level understanding of the impact that change has on
the build.
Future improvements include charts on cumulative damage when hitting more
than 1 mob,
